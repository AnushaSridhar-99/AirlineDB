The purpose of Airline Management System is to automate the existing manual system by the help of computerizing equipment and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling requirements, so that their valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same. The required software and hardware are easily available and easy to work with.
Our project Airline Management System includes home page that allows user to check availability of flights. Using this software, we can check availability of flights and book tickets.
The Airline Management System portal can be accessed using username and password of the admin. The interface we have created is very user-friendly. Airline Database Management System, as described above, can lead to error free, secure, reliable and fast management system. It can assist the user to concentrate on their other activities rather than record keeping. Thus, it will help organization in better utilization of resources. The organization can maintain computerized records without redundant entries.
